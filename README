=== How to install Fedora and Solr for use with ActiveFedora ===

Follow this guide http://projects.mediashelf.us/projects/active-fedora/wiki/Setting_up_Fedora_and_Solr_for_use_with_ActiveFedora. Dont forget to use latest versions of Fedora and Solr

Most links in that guide are broken, so
Fedora commons (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fedora-commons/)
Solr (http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/)

While installing Fedora, you may also check this article http://asingh.com.np/blog/fedora-commons-installation-and-configuration-guide/ (install fedora commons chapter)

At the last step, where you need to copy
cp [PATH TO ACTIVE FEDORA CODE]/solr/config/schema.xml $FEDORA_HOME/solr/conf/

do not use that scheme.
use attached one. I got it from jetty server - schema.xml

Do not forget to setup env vars.
In Linux you may add them to your .bashrc file

# ActiveFedora
export FEDORA_HOME=/home/ap/.fedora
export CATALINA_HOME=$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat

To run server

$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
To stop

$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh

In Example App from "How to install and run ActiveFedora as soon as possible." to use this configuration, rename fedora_custom.xml to fedora.xml (and double check all configurations in that file)
